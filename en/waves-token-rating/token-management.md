# Token management

If you are a token issuer, call up the top right corner of the account menu and select **My tokens**. The dashboard for your tokens will open.

If you haven't issued any tokens from this account yet, you will be asked for token creation.

If you are a token issuer and have already created tokens, you will see a list of tokens issued from this account with a name and ID on the left side.

The general information about the selected token is displayed in the right part and includes

* ID (assetId)
* Token name from issue transaction
* Description from issue transaction

Options with token are available below:

* Add ticker
* Add a link to the website
* Add additional information

## Ticker

If your token has a high rating, WCT weight, and votes sum, you can create a ticker for that token for the exchange. A ticker is a tokenâ€™s unique identifier, used by exchanges and as a currency code by users.

The ticker should be unique and consist of up to six uppercase characters.

After adding a ticker, it is impossible to edit or change it.

## Website

You can add a link to the website of your token or project.

This information will only be displayed on the Token Rating token card.

You can always change this information.

## Additional information

If the description you specified when issued the token is obsolete, or if you want to extend it by specifying additional information about your token or project, you can add an additional description.

This information will only be displayed on the Token Rating token card, along with a description from the token issue transaction.

You can always change this information.
