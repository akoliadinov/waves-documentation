# Standard Library

The **Standard Library** is a set of [built-in functions](/ride/functions/built-in-functions.md) of the [script context](/ride/script/script-context.md).

There are three versions of the Standard Library â€” 1, 2 and 3.

The version of the Standard Library used in the script is set by the `STDLIB_VERSION` [directive](/ride/script/directives.md).

It is advised to use version 3 of the Standard Library when developing applications; versions 1 and 2 are required for backward compatibility.
