# Script body

A **script body** is the source code of the [script](/ride/script.md) that follows immediately after the [directives](/ride/script/directives.md).

The body of a [dApp script](/ride/script/script-types/dapp-script.md) is a _set_ of [definitions](/ride/base-concepts/definition.md).

The body of an [account script](/ride/script/script-types/account-script.md) and an [asset script](/ride/script/script-types/asset-script.md) is an [expression](/ride/base-concepts/expression.md).

The `CONTENT_TYPE` [directive](/ride/script/directives.md) defines what the script body is â€” an expression or a set of definitions.
