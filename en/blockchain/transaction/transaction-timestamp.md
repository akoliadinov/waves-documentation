# Transaction timestamp

**Transaction timestamp** is a time specified by the sender when the transaction was sent to the [blockchain network](/blockchain/blockchain-network.md).

The actual time differs from the timestamp value by no more than 2 hours back and 1.5 hours forward.

The time is specified in _milliseconds_ that have passed since the beginning of the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
