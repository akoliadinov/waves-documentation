# Order timestamp

An **order timestamp** is a time when [matcher](/waves-node/extensions/matcher.md) adds the [order](/blockchain/order.md) to the [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_%28trading%29) on [DEX](/waves-dex/about-waves-dex.md).

The time is specified in _milliseconds_ that have passed since the beginning of the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
